            "content": "**China's Potential Bitcoin Strategy: A Response to the US Reserve?**\n\nSpeculation mounts regarding China's potential response to the United States' newly established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.  Following President Trump's March 7th executive order creating the reserve, funded initially with seized Bitcoin and other digital assets, questions arise about whether China will develop its own national cryptocurrency strategy.\n\nBitcoin advocate David Bailey suggests China may be formulating a response, citing reportedly closed-door meetings on Bitcoin since the 2024 US elections, although this remains unconfirmed.\n\nThe US currently holds 198,109 BTC, valued at over $17 billion, and plans to treat this reserve as a long-term store of value, aiming for budget-neutral acquisition of more Bitcoin.\n\nChina's Bitcoin holdings are undisclosed.  In 2020, authorities seized approximately 195,000 BTC from the PlusToken Ponzi scheme, with profits forfeited to the national treasury.  However, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju speculated that China may have already sold these holdings, citing the CCP's unlikely embrace of \"censorship-resistant money,\" though he acknowledged this as a personal opinion.  The transfer of these coins to the national treasury doesn't clarify whether they were sold.\n\nShould China retain these reserves and adopt a similar strategy to the US, it could become one of the world's largest Bitcoin holders.\n\nWhile Beijing's stance remains unclear, Hong Kong is exploring Bitcoin adoption within its unique political framework.  Hong Kong lawmaker Wu Jiexhuang suggested studying the market impact of US Bitcoin ETFs, noting the potential influence of Trump's proposal on traditional markets.",
