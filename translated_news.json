            "content": "**Wallet in Telegram Expands Crypto Services with 50+ New Assets and Earn Feature**\n\nTelegram's third-party cryptocurrency wallet, Wallet in Telegram, is significantly expanding its services.  A major update, rolled out by The Open Platform (TOP), is adding at least 50 new cryptocurrencies and an \"Earn\" feature.\n\nThe expansion includes major cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) and XRP, as well as memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE).  The rollout, occurring over the next two months, will initially restrict non-TON token transactions to in-app trading only;  users won't be able to deposit or withdraw these assets to external wallets or exchanges.\n\nThe \"Earn\" feature will initially offer flexible yields on Toncoin (TON) deposits, with a minimum of 0.1 TON required.  These yields are generated from TON staking.  The plan is to subsequently expand the \"Earn\" feature to include other altcoins and stablecoins like Tether's USDT.\n\nA \"Trade\" section is also under development.  While the initial rollout includes 50 assets, the final list of supported cryptocurrencies is still being finalized.",
