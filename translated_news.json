            "translated_facebook_post": "Kalau Trump pecat Powell, mungkin pasaran kripto akan jadi tak menentu.  Risiko ekonomi Amerika makin tinggi, pelabur mungkin cari alternatif lain, termasuklah kripto. Tapi, kejatuhan ekonomi Amerika juga boleh menjejaskan kripto, terutamanya stablecoin.  Kesimpulannya, situasi ini penuh dengan ketidakpastian.",
            "translated_title": "Jika Trump memecat Powell, apakah yang akan berlaku kepada kripto?",
            "translated_content": "**The Trump-Powell Standoff and its Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency**\n\nRecent months have witnessed a recurring pattern: President Trump takes economically harmful actions, causing market crashes.  He then pressures Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, a move Powell consistently rejects.  Trump desires lower rates for their stimulative effect on the economy and to bolster his image. Powell, however, prioritizes adhering to economic standards, maintaining the Fed's dual mandates (maximizing employment and stable prices), and preserving the Fed's perceived independence from political influence.\n\nThe Fed's independence is crucial.  If markets lose faith in this independence, the cost of borrowing for the U.S. (already burdened by a $30 trillion debt) will increase significantly, potentially leading to an economic crisis.  Trump's recent threats to fire Powell caused market unease, but he has (for now) backed down after concerns were raised by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  However, the situation remains volatile.\n\n\n**The Legal Precedent and Potential Consequences**\n\nThe President's ability to fire the Fed chair is legally questionable. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the 1935 Supreme Court case *Humphrey's Executor v. United States* limit the President's power of removal.  Overturning this precedent would grant future presidents sweeping control over the Fed, a move many believe would be disastrous.  Economists generally agree that political interference in central banking is detrimental, citing historical examples like the stagflation of the 1970s and the hyperinflation in Weimar Germany, Argentina, and Venezuela.\n\n\n**Cryptocurrency's Potential Role**\n\nThe potential firing of Powell would severely test the cryptocurrency industry.  Bitcoin's creation was partly motivated by a desire to circumvent traditional financial institutions.  A collapse of the Fed's credibility could strengthen this original thesis.  Recent market behavior suggests investors are seeking alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, amid Trump's actions.  While Bitcoin's price has historically tracked the Nasdaq, this correlation seems to be weakening, prompting speculation about a \"decoupling\" from traditional markets.\n\n\n**Potential Downsides for Crypto**\n\nHowever, a complete collapse of the US financial system wouldn't necessarily benefit crypto.  A potential Treasury default, as speculated by economist Noah Smith, could devastate stablecoins like USDC and USDT, leading to a market crash.  The loss of the US dollar's status as the world's reserve currency could also shift global financial power to the EU or China, leading to increased regulation of cryptocurrency in those regions.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe outcome of the Trump-Powell conflict remains uncertain. The potential consequences, both for the US economy and the cryptocurrency market, are far-reaching and unpredictable.  The situation highlights the interconnectedness of global finance and the potential for unforeseen consequences from political actions.",
