In a letter to Strike investors on April 25th, Mallers stated that his role at Twenty One Capital is an \"extension\" of his commitment to Strike, highlighting Strike's impressive performance: over $6 billion in transaction volume in 2024, representing 600% year-over-year growth, an 85% gross profit margin, and zero customer acquisition costs.  With a team of 75 employees, Strike projects 8-9 figures in net profit for 2025.\n\nMallers emphasized that while Strike focuses on global Bitcoin accessibility, Twenty One Capital aims to increase Bitcoin ownership per share and develop Bitcoin-native financial tools.  He clarified that although separate entities, both companies share the same core belief: \"Bitcoin wins, we win.\"  This philosophy, Mallers explained, underpins every business decision he makes.\n\nTwenty One Capital, launched on April 23rd with backing from Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald, intends to rival Michael Saylor's strategy, aiming to be the preferred investment vehicle for efficient Bitcoin exposure.  The firm launched with 42,000 Bitcoin.\n\nMallers' dual roles prompted speculation on social media regarding the future of Strike, with some questioning whether a new CEO would be appointed.  While some industry participants have speculated about a potential acquisition of Strike by Twenty One Capital, neither Mallers nor Strike has confirmed any such plans.",
